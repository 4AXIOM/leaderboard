- Notes: S42: RoboCasa 1.0.1, split=pretrain, 50 tasks x 50 episodes, 207/2500 successes (8.28%). R5 fine-tuned GR00T-N1.5 generates four candidates; frozen W5 LY-GWM predicts future features/state; a separate S38 binary state-reward head selects the maximum logit. The scorer is not a goal-conditioned value function. The previous 200/2500 submission is superseded by this S42 submission and is not evidence of LY-GWM-based action selection; the current submission uses S42's 207/2500 result and its corresponding public code, weights and evaluation records. S42 passed revised INTERNAL acceptance: after the run, nonzero action-bound counts became diagnostic-only; original zero-bound acceptance failed. 1822 affected episodes include 149 successful episodes; all 2500 remain in the denominator. No new rollouts were performed by the revised collector. Historical S31 was 181/2500 (7.24%); the +1.04 percentage-point difference is descriptive, without a causal or significance claim; S31 contemporaneous weight-shard hashes are unavailable. Historical full raw action traces are not bundled; recorded audit reports and trace hashes are supplied. New-machine reviewer entrypoints have CPU/static checks only, not a completed GPU reproduction. The local public-checkpoint versus official-reference performance gap remains unresolved. Source and inference weights are public subject to preserved component terms. Official acceptance is for the maintainers to determine.
